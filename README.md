# DATA-ARMY

📊 Project Overview
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of global agricultural productivity from 1990 to 2013, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict crop yields and identify key drivers. The analysis covers 101 countries and 10 crop types, providing insights for farmers, policymakers, and agricultural researchers facing challenges from climate change.

🔍 Key Findings

Temporal Trends

•	27.2% increase in crop yields from 1990 to 2013

•	Year is a significant predictor (correlation: 0.243)

Pesticide Impact

•	High pesticide usage increased yields by 25.1%

•	Strongest predictor with crop-specific variations

Environmental Factors

•	Rainfall: Weak correlation (0.013), with 4.2% higher yields above 2,000 mm/year

•	Temperature: 21.0% higher yields above 30°C, challenging heat stress assumptions

Model Performance

•	Decision Tree Regressor: R² = 0.9816, MAE = 3,294.61 hg/ha

•	KNN Regressor: R² = 0.9880, MAE = 3,548.45 hg/ha

•	Linear Models: R² ≈ 0.8014, MAE ≈ 22,780 hg/ha

📈 Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations:

•	Average crop yield over time

•	Correlation matrix of numerical features

💡 Recommendations

Model Improvements

•	Tune Decision Tree hyperparameters

•	Explore ensemble methods

•	Add more polynomial features for environmental factors
Data Expansion

•	Incorporate post-2013 data

•	Add features like soil type, irrigation, or crop genetics

•	Balance crop and country representation

Policy Implications

•	Optimize pesticide use based on crop-specific benefits

•	Promote heat-tolerant crops in high-temperature regions

•	Support agricultural innovation to sustain yield increases
